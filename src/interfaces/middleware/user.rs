//! Caller-id-based user guards.
//!
//! All guards in this module take `(auth, caller_id) → Result<(), AppError>`
//! so handlers compose them uniformly as one-liners. They assume the
//! caller has already been authenticated by the
//! [`AuthUser`](super::auth::AuthUser) extractor, and pull the current
//! user state from the database via `AuthApplicationService` so role /
//! external-flag changes take effect on the next request without
//! waiting for token rotation.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let caller_id = auth_user.id;
//! require_internal_user(&auth, caller_id).await?;
//! require_admin_user(&auth, caller_id).await?;
//! ```
//!
//! Future role-based guards (e.g. `require_active_user`) should follow
//! the same shape so they slot in next to these without ceremony.
//!
//! For the legacy header-based admin guard (`require_admin`), see
//! [`super::admin`] — that variant exists because some handlers take
//! `headers: HeaderMap` directly instead of `AuthUser`.
