//! Authorization port — the trait every service depends on for permission
//! decisions. Implementations: `PgAclEngine` (v1 default), `OpenFgaEngine`
//! (future). A `CachedAuthorizationEngine` decorator over either is planned
//! as a future optimization.
//!
//! Architectural rule (see CLAUDE.md):
//! **AuthZ is enforced exclusively in the application service layer.**
//! Handlers authenticate the caller and pass `caller_id` to the service;
//! they never call this trait directly.
